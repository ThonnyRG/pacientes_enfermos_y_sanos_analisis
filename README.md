# Biotecnologic Data analyst 

This project involves the analysis of heart rate data from 50,000 samples collected from both healthy individuals and patients with heart conditions.

## Objective

The primary goal of this study is to analyze heart rate segments and identify patterns that differentiate healthy individuals from patients with heart failure.
## Key Findings

- Power Law Distribution:
Consistent with previous research, the distribution of heart rate segments exhibits a power-law behavior, demonstrating that the interval between heartbeats has a scale-invariant structure.
- Statistical Differences:
Comparing the statistical distributions of heart rates between healthy individuals and patients with heart failure reveals significant differences in key parameters.
- Health Status Indicators:
Variations in the shape of the relative frequency distribution of heart rate segments can serve as potential indicators of an individualâ€™s health status.
